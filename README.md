First, 
1) One manipulates stickiness parameters
2) Varies expected reward --> is it reward-driven or just random?
3) Information maximization

List of task changes:
    1. Between March 27th to April 3rd, the task was changed:
        - The session was reduced from 45 min to 30 min
        - The reward volume was reduced from 7.5 uL to 3.5 uL
        - The state transition probability was increased from 0.02 to 0.04
    2. Between April 4th and April 5th, the task was changed:
        - The debounce for the lickometers was increased from 5 to 100
    3. Between April 5th and April 6th, the task was changed:
        - The state transition probability wsas decreased from 0.04 to 0.03
    4. Between April 7th and April 8th, the task was changed:
        - The reward volume was increased from 3.5 uL to 5 uL
    5. Between April 8th and April 9th, the task was changed:
        - The reward volume was decreased from 5 uL to 3.5 uL
        - The ITI was increased from 2 seconds to 3 seconds
    6. Between April 9th and April 10th, the task was changed:
        - The ITI was increased from 3 seconds to 4 seconds
    7. Between 

TO DO for 5/20:
--The first time after the mouse leaves the high arm, does it go to the low arm or to the random?
--For WT, what do they do after they don't get rewarded twice in a row?
--Plot things as percentage
--for each mouse: aligned to block change. over the next 10 or so trials (so plot trial number from block change on the x-axis) % (average over all block changes) of choosing new high arm, random arm, new low arm  (check if the resulting curves look the same for the two types of block change (1 to 3 vs 3 to 1))
--summary plots of this for all mice 90/10 and 80/20
--summary plot of behaviour during 'stable' period for all mice: the bar plots you already have of how many trials on low, high, random after the mouse has stabilized at the high port until block end, but plotted as % of trials within this period, averaged for each mouse, and all mice plotted together with individual data points for each mouse.
--statistical power analysis: how many trials do we have that are not the high arm and how consistent is that across animals?
--parameter fitting on synthetic data
